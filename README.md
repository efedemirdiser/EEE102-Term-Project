# Bilkent University-EEE 102-Digital Logic Design-Term Project
In this project, I designed an extensive alarm system on Basys 3 FPGA using VHDL. I also used some additional components such as a PIR motion sensor, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a 4x4 keypad, a buzzer, some LEDs, and a breadboard. Compared to a usual alarm system, my project had some additional properties like a distance condition together with the motion sensor, a limit for entering the password incorrectly (3 times in a row), and multiple seven segment display options such as the password input display, distance display, and the number of incorrect password inputs display. The project was successful and a great opportunity for me to implement the objectives covered in EEE 102 lectures.
